# Welcome to the Humanized AI Robot Hakatoon Book

This textbook is your comprehensive guide to the exciting world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Whether you are a student, a hobbyist, or a professional looking to expand your skills, this book will provide you with the knowledge and practical experience you need to build and program your own humanoid robots.

Our course is structured to take you from the fundamental concepts of robotics to advanced topics in AI-powered control. Each chapter is designed to be a self-contained module with clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises.

### What You Will Learn

-   The integration of **Vision, Language, and Action** models for intelligent behavior.
-   How to complete a **capstone project** to build an autonomous humanoid robot.

### How to Use This Book

We recommend that you follow the chapters in order, as they are designed to build upon each other. However, if you have prior experience with certain topics, feel free to jump to the chapters that are most relevant to you.

Each chapter includes a "Task Plan and Constitution" section that outlines the practical exercises and hands-on tasks. We strongly encourage you to complete these exercises to get the most out of this course.
