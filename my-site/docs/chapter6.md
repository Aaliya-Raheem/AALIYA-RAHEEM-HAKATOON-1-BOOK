## Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

Welcome to the final chapter of this course! In this capstone project, you will bring together everything you have learned to build an autonomous humanoid robot. This project will challenge you to apply your knowledge of Physical AI, ROS 2, digital twin simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision Language Action models.

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a humanoid robot that can perform a simple task autonomously. The specific task is up to you, but it should involve some combination of perception, navigation, and manipulation.

### Project Phases

The project is divided into several phases:

1.  **Design and Planning:** In this phase, you will define the specific goals of your project, choose a robot platform, and create a detailed project plan.
2.  **Simulation:** In this phase, you will create a digital twin of your robot in Gazebo or Unity and test your software in simulation.
3.  **Hardware Integration:** In this phase, you will assemble your physical robot and integrate it with your ROS 2 workspace.
4.  **AI Integration:** In this phase, you will integrate your AI models (e.g., object detection, VLA) into your robot's control system.
5.  **Testing and Demonstration:** In this phase, you will test your robot's ability to perform the task autonomously and demonstrate its capabilities.

### Task Plan and Constitution

This chapter's task plan will guide you through each phase of the capstone project.

**Practical Exercise: Project Proposal**

1.  **Define Your Project:** Write a one-page project proposal that outlines the goals of your project, the robot platform you will use, and a high-level project plan.
2.  **Get Feedback:** Share your project proposal with your peers and get feedback on your ideas.

### AI Integration Examples

This project is all about AI integration. You will have the opportunity to experiment with different AI models and techniques to create a truly intelligent and autonomous robot.
